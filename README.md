<h1>Martynov Vyacheslav</h1>

I am a pre-junior iOS developer with unbeatable desire to conquer the world.
IT seems an appealing sphere to me as it is fast-pacing environment encouraging you to improve your skills endlessly.
I wish I've started my education a decade earlier, but I strongly believe that age is a social construct.

<h3>My skills</h3>

1. Thrive for education
1. Swift knowledge (still pending)
1. OOP knowledge (in progress)
1. SwiftUI (in plans)
1. Unkillable optimism
